# CLAUDE.md

Project-local rules live outside gyrum marker blocks; everything between markers is managed by `gyrum-setup --sync-claudemd`.

## Local commands
- `npm test` — Vitest suite (79 tests) including the autopilot that races the circuit in simulation and asserts lap completion, on-track %, pace, steering calm.
- `npm run build` — typecheck + production bundle; `npm run dev` — Vite dev server on :5173.
- Physics is a deterministic fixed-timestep core: never read wall-clock time in sim code; drive everything from the accumulator loop.

## Repo shape
- `src/` — TypeScript app (Three.js scene, physics, HUD overlays); `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` is the deep-dive.
- Tests are the contract: a physics change lands with a test that fails before and passes after (TDD).

## Template governance — DO NOT hand-edit gyrum-* markered blocks

Sections enclosed by `<!-- gyrum-*-vN:START --> ... <!-- gyrum-*-vN:END -->` markers are managed by `gyrum-setup`. Canonical source: `~/.gyrum/devtools/templates/CLAUDE-*.md`.

**To change a templated rule:** edit the source in `gyrum-labs/devtools/templates/`, bump `vN` → `vN+1` in both markers, land via the standard PR flow, then `gyrum-setup --sync-claudemd` in each consumer (or wait for the next routine pass).

**Hand-edits inside markers are CLOBBERED on next sync** — the awk-based sync drops everything between markers and inserts the current template body. **Hand-edits OUTSIDE markers are preserved** — that's the space for project-local rules.

**Why:** templated sections enforce fleet-wide rules; hand-editing in one repo creates drift the next agent reads as canonical. To propose a new fleet-wide rule, open a PR against `gyrum-labs/devtools/templates/`, not a project's `CLAUDE.md`.

## Devtools

Gyrum devtools install at `~/.gyrum/devtools/`, on PATH via `~/.local/bin/gyrum-*`. Prefer these over hand-rolling — they own the workflow contract (hooks, review gates, finding journal, worktree isolation). The "simpler-looking" alternative bypasses every gate.

**Full command reference (all flags + exit codes), the always-on background-mechanism table (cadence/tunables), and the *Why* + mechanics behind every rule below live in [`docs/gyrum/devtools.md`](docs/gyrum/devtools.md).** Open it before: looking up a `gyrum-*` command's full flags or exit-codes, a background mechanism's cadence (`wip-checkpoint` / `heartbeat` / `agent-guard` / `deployed-sync`), or the rationale + recovery path behind a STRICT rule you're about to bypass.

### Core commands

| Command | When to use |
|---|---|
| `gyrum-start-work <name> --ticket warp#NNN` | Start a feature: isolates into a fresh sibling clone, creates branch + draft PR. Final stdout line `WORKTREE: <abs-path>` — non-interactive callers `cd` there before the next command. |
| `gyrum-review-pr` / `gyrum-complete-pr` | Local 3-persona review, then pre-PR checks + merge. Review IS the review; no external step. |
| `gyrum-pre-flight` | Forced attestation (3-digit pin) before `gyrum-review-pr`; use after >15 min autonomous work. |
| `gyrum-recover` | After non-zero `gyrum-review-pr`: prints the canonical re-pass message per failed gate. |
| `gyrum-pr-edit <PR#> --body-file <f>` (also `--title`, `--add-label`) | Edit a PR body / title / label. Use INSTEAD of raw `gh pr edit` — the raw command silently DROPS body edits (exits 0 while discarding the write; warp#7874) AND errors on a deprecated GitHub field before applying the edit on gyrum repos; this wrapper routes around both (REST-first body path). After any body edit, read it back with `gh pr view <PR#> --json body` — the silent-drop means only a read-back proves the edit landed (warp#12220). |
| `gyrum-brief --ticket warp#NNNN` | Substrate-assembled dispatch brief (byte-identical for identical input); replaces hand-rolling. |
| `gyrum-verify-shipped warp#NNN` / `gyrum-dispatch-check warp#NNN` | Assert a dep's cited PR is MERGED; freshness-check before `Agent(...)` dispatch. |
| `gyrum-warp search "<kw>"` / `gyrum-warp preview <id>` | Find + inspect related tickets before filing or claiming. |
| `gyrum-followup-proposals --dry-run` | End-of-work follow-up tickets (duplicate-search + `--pattern`, or `--route architecture-vote`). |
| `gyrum-fleet <subcommand>` / `gyrum-warp <id>` / `gyrum-workspace <name>` / `gyrum-implement` / `gyrum-help` | Fleet supervisor CLI; one-shot ticket-to-merge; spike clone; scaffold a step; full list. |
| `gyrum-devtools diagnose "<error-signature-or-text>"` | The "RAG the system queries itself" verb: search the auto-diagnosis library → guidelines → runbooks → ADRs and print the best diagnosis + proposed_fix. Run before improvising on an error. (warp#10439) |
| `gyrum-devtools validate-auto-diagnosis <entry.yaml>...` \| `--dir <path>` \| `--all` | ADR-168 §5 wire-edge gate for auto-diagnosis library entries + sister fixtures. Runs at PR-author / detector startup / hot-reload. (warp#10439) |

### Workflow rules — STRICT (for AI agents, Claude Code, and humans)

- **NEVER** merge via `gh pr merge` (incl. `--squash`). ALWAYS `gyrum-review-pr` → `gyrum-complete-pr` from the feature branch (convention is `--merge`; the wrappers verify review, run structural checks, tag the version).
- **NEVER** POST to `/pulls/:n/reviews` with a persona PAT + your own prose — that bypasses the 3-persona AI review.
- **NEVER** use `--no-verify` (push) or `--admin` (merge) unless the operator authorised it in writing for that PR. warp#3100 Path-A atomic canon PRs auto-skip the diff-size gate (warp#3702) — do NOT reach for `--admin` on them.
- **NEVER** override `--ignore-failing-checks` (warp#3107) to silence a real broken test — `gyrum-warp add` an unblocker, `gyrum-warp block` this one, return when it ships.
- **NEVER** trust an `AGENT-TERMINAL` / `MERGED` claim from a sub-agent that exited non-clean (watchdog-kill / timeout / rate-limit / crash) (warp#3144) — `gh pr view <N> --json mergedAt,state,mergeStateStatus,statusCheckRollup` first.
- **NEVER** bypass a pre-push hook failure — fix the root cause; the failure is the gate doing its job.
- **ALWAYS** run `gyrum-review-pr` before opening a PR (it gates build/test/coverage/complexity/file-length/gosec/staticcheck the persona review does not), then `gyrum-complete-pr` immediately on its `READY-TO-MERGE` directive (warp#1342); run `gyrum-pre-flight` first after >15 min autonomous work (warp#1387), and `gyrum-recover` on any non-zero exit.
- **ALWAYS** distinguish `AGENT-TERMINAL — merged` (mergedAt non-null; exit, don't poll) from `ENROLLED-NOT-YET-MERGED` (verify via `gh pr view`, then wait/unblock/escalate) on `gyrum-complete-pr`'s final line (warp#3362).
<!-- doc-truth: ignore-next -->
- **ALWAYS** start work via `gyrum-start-work <name> --ticket warp#NNN` (or `--no-ticket` for trivial); the pre-push hook refuses `feat|fix|chore|docs|refactor/*` lacking `.gyrum/branch-meta.json` (warp#1311). Parse the final `WORKTREE:`/`WORKTREE-IN-PLACE:` line and `cd` there before the next Bash call (warp#2593) — non-interactive subshells don't auto-cd. The merge side has the same contract: `gyrum-complete-pr` run from a non-interactive shell REFUSES (printing ~N candidate worktrees) unless invoked from inside the worktree with `GYRUM_WORKDIR=<worktree-abs-path>` exported (warp#9796) — a DIFFERENT variable from `GYRUM_WORKDIR_ROOT`, which only governs cleanup-root resolution (warp#12220).
- **ALWAYS** write commit-message bodies one paragraph per line (the `commit-msg` hook refuses hard-wrap; bypass `git commit --no-verify`).
- **ALWAYS** answer the PR body's `## Friction` section when a previous `gyrum-review-pr` pass recorded findings (warp#10961): `none` or one line per previous-pass finding (fixed / worked around + why), inside the `gyrum:friction` markers — placeholders are refused, clean PRs (no prior findings) are ignored. If you changed your PR to please a check you believe is WRONG, say so — that is the friction signal the daily aggregate clusters; in the end-of-ticket retro, prefix the friction answer `workaround: <gate>` (files immediately, deduped) or `latent: <subject>` (rides the daily aggregate). Override `--skip-friction "<reason ≥ 10 chars>"`.
- **ALWAYS** land a regression test with every `type: bug` fix — fail-before / pass-after, named or `// regression: warp#NNN`, on the ticket's `surface:` layer (warp#1008). Override `--skip-regression-fixture "<reason>"`.
<!-- doc-truth: ignore-next -->
- **ALWAYS** declare `tier` on every public-IP'd server in `infrastructure/server-ids.json` (and on ansible/`*.tf` diffs); `bff`/`bastion` need `tier_justification`, `internal` needs `exposed_ports` + `trusted_inbound` (ADR-175 / warp#1978). Carry a `## Trust-boundary audit` section on any credential-co-tenancy / privilege-escalation diff (docker/sudo/wheel, cred paths, `privileged`/docker.sock/`cap_add`) (warp#6357). Override `--skip-trust-boundary "<reason ≥ 10 chars>"`.
- **ALWAYS** ship docs alongside any new `scripts/<name>.sh` / `ansible/roles/<name>/` / ticket-filing workflow — the `doc-pair` gate names the required companion (warp#1981). Override `--skip-doc-pair "<reason ≥ 10 chars>"`.
- **ALWAYS** assemble dispatch briefs via `gyrum-brief --ticket warp#NNNN` (warp#1527); `gyrum-verify-shipped warp#NNN` before treating a dep as satisfied (warp#2915); `gyrum-dispatch-check warp#NNN` before `Agent(...)` dispatch (warp#3710) — refuse to dispatch on exit 1/2/3/4. Bypass `--skip-already-shipped "<reason ≥ 20 chars>"` only for genuine ship-again.
- **ALWAYS** ask at wrap-up whether follow-up tickets should be raised; use `gyrum-followup-proposals --dry-run` before filing (warp#2968).
- **Persona recusal** (warp#1392): commits from a persona bot (`gyrum-priya|marcus|lin|dana|sasha|quinn`) recuse that persona (quorum → 2-of-2); two-or-more default recusals fail closed; each appends a `findings.jsonl` line.
- **Merge-gate quorum** (warp#7705): the 2-of-3 quorum is enforced at MERGE, not just review. `gyrum-complete-pr` proceeds on 2-of-3 (or 2-of-2 after recusal) APPROVED even with exactly ONE `CHANGES_REQUESTED` — via the normal fleet path (NOT `--admin`/`--no-verify`), auto-filing the lone dissent as a follow-up ticket + an audit line (`quorum-merge-with-dissent`). Two-or-more `CHANGES_REQUESTED` → refuse; the ≥2-recusal fail-closed rule is unchanged.
- **Sister-agent collision detection** (warp#1511 / warp#1517): `gyrum-start-work` refuses >2-file (or >50%/≥3-file) open-PR overlap unless `--allow-collision "<reason ≥ 10 chars>"`; sibling to the warp#1108 issue-overlap check.
<!-- doc-truth: ignore-next -->
- **Force-push policy** (warp#1340): `policy/git-force-policy.md` — `--force-with-lease` on agent `feat|fix|chore/*` worktrees only; plain `--force` refused anywhere; force-push to `main`/`master` refused with no exception. Sandbox-blocked recovery: non-force `git merge origin/main` fast-forward, NOT `--no-verify` / `--admin`.

## Warp — agent work coordination

Warp is the fleet's agent work inbox — a Postgres-backed HTTP queue. Each session checks Warp first for items reserved for its label, then unreserved items, claims atomically (`SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`), heartbeats every 5 min, and marks `complete` / `release` / `block` on exit. Env: `WARP_URL` / `WARP_TOKEN` / `WARP_LABEL` from `~/.config/gyrum/control-plane.env`.

**Full protocol — REST cheatsheet, env setup, and the rationale + mechanics behind every rule below — lives in [`docs/gyrum/warp.md`](docs/gyrum/warp.md).** Open it before: filing your 3rd related ticket in an hour (EPIC batching), routing a ticket to the right repo (substrate routing), patching a supervisor kill threshold (`self-fix:` tag), reclaiming a live claim, or swarming an epic.

### Shell wrappers

| Command | When to use |
|---|---|
| `gyrum-warp ready` | List Ready items you can claim. `--all` / `--repo <name>` / `--stale` (high+urgent >24h). |
| `gyrum-warp preflight <uuid>` | **Recommended entrypoint.** Resolves UUID, prints title+desc, refuses non-ready, claims atomically. |
| `gyrum-warp claim <id>` | Atomic claim. 409 = another agent won; pick another. |
| `gyrum-warp complete <id> --pr <url>` | Terminal success; always include the merged PR URL. |
| `gyrum-warp release <id>` | Voluntary unclaim — cooperative handoff, not a failure. |
| `gyrum-warp block <id> --reason "…"` | Flag an external blocker; item returns to Ready as `blocked`. |
| `gyrum-warp unblock <id> [--reason "…"]` | Symmetric inverse of `block`. |
| `gyrum-warp add` / `--file item.md` | Add new work discovered mid-session. |
| `gyrum-warp update <id> [flags]` | Self-edit a ticket you created (own items, categorical fields). `--type <type>` fixes a mis-typed ticket (bug/feature/chore/docs/refactor/epic/infra_request); server owns the enum (warp#7884). |
| `gyrum-warp search "<kw>"` / `gyrum-warp preview <id>` | Find + inspect related tickets before filing/claiming. |

### Workflow rules — STRICT (for AI agents, Claude Code, and humans)

- **ALWAYS** check Warp at session start; reserved items belong to you — finish them first.
- **ALWAYS** heartbeat every ≤5 min while claimed; an expired lease returns the item to Ready.
- **ALWAYS** inspect `cancel_requested` on heartbeats; `true` = finish the atomic unit, push WIP, `gyrum-warp release` (do NOT `complete` partial work).
- **ALWAYS** create a Warp item for follow-up work discovered mid-session.
- **ALWAYS** search (`gyrum-warp search`/`gyrum-warp preview`) + cross-link (`depends_on`/`blocked_by`/`parent`) before filing or claiming structural work.
- **ALWAYS**: file a parent EPIC first when ≥3 related tickets are coming (warp#2980); reserve a ticket you'll work yourself at file time (warp#4307); swarm an epic by setting it `in_progress` (warp#3051); tag supervisor-kill-threshold patches `self-fix:<component>` (warp#3014). Mechanics + Why → `docs/gyrum/warp.md`.
- **NEVER** reserve to hoard; **NEVER** log your `WARP_TOKEN`; **NEVER** `/complete` a half-done item (use `/release` or `/block`).
- **NEVER** bypass `--skip-cluster-check` / `--skip-substrate-routing-check` to silence a real cluster / misroute — bypass is for genuine false positives only.
- **NEVER** force over another agent's fresh, heartbeating claim — use the cooperative `POST /cancel` → claim-when-it-frees path (`docs/gyrum/warp.md`). `gyrum-complete-pr --admin` over a live claim needs explicit per-PR operator authorization.

## Daily session log

The fleet keeps a daily diary at `<workspace-root>/dark-factory/docs/sessions/<date>.md` — the fleet's central hub at [`gyrum-labs/dark-factory`](https://github.com/gyrum-labs/dark-factory). The dated file is **AUTO-GENERATED, not hand-written** (warp#6817): do NOT create or edit `docs/sessions/<date>.md` yourself. Every session hand-writing the same dated file add/add-conflicted at the second merge and dropped all-but-one session's summary — generating it removes the collision at the root.

If `dark-factory` isn't cloned, run `gh repo clone gyrum-labs/dark-factory` once. If you genuinely can't reach it, record that in your session output and skip the diary — don't fork a per-repo `docs/sessions/` directory.

### How the generated log works

`gyrum-session-log` renders `docs/sessions/<date>.md` IDEMPOTENTLY from three authoritative sources, so re-running is always safe (deterministic overwrite, last-writer-wins on identical content):

1. `gyrum-merged-today --format md` — the "What shipped" PRs block.
2. Warp ticket closures for the local day — tickets that went `done` that day (the "Tickets closed" section).
3. Per-session NARRATIVE fragments at `docs/sessions/<date>/<session-id>.md` — folded into "Session notes". Each session writes its OWN fragment file, so fragments are collision-free; a session NEVER touches the shared dated file.

### At session start

1. `ls <workspace-root>/dark-factory/docs/sessions/` — read TODAY's generated `docs/sessions/<date>.md` (and its `docs/sessions/<date>/` fragment dir) plus yesterday's. That's your fleet state.
2. Don't create `docs/sessions/<date>.md`. If it doesn't exist yet, run `gyrum-session-log` (or just drop your fragment — the generator renders it).

### During session — drop a fragment, don't write the dated file

Write YOUR narrative to `docs/sessions/<date>/<session-id>.md` (resolve `<session-id>` via `~/.gyrum/devtools/lib/session-id.sh` → `warp_session_id`, or use `HH:MM-{WARP_LABEL}`). Seed it from `~/.gyrum/devtools/templates/daily-session-log.template.md` if you want the section scaffold. Append to YOUR fragment as events happen (PR merged, agent spawned, decision made, drift discovered) — don't batch. Don't edit other sessions' fragments; they own their narratives.

REQUIRED: record every warp ticket you touch this session on a single `Tickets touched: warp#…` line in your fragment. The dossier assembler walks fragments by ticket number to bridge date → epic, so a fragment with no ticket line is invisible to it.

If a goal-completion check applies, cite `goal:<slug>` in your fragment — the goal-completion-gate reads either the generated dated file OR the fragment dir.

### Before a status report or session end

Run `gyrum-session-log` to re-render the rolled-up dated file from merged-today + warp closures + every fragment. Your fragment should carry: Tickets touched (`warp#…`), TL;DR (3-5 sentences), What's running (live agents), Open PRs needing review, Architectural decisions, Known drift, Queued for future (link DEBT.md), For the user (morning checklist). "What shipped" and "Tickets closed" are auto-derived — you don't hand-list them.

### Rules

- The dated `docs/sessions/<date>.md` is generated — never hand-edit it; it carries an `AUTO-GENERATED` header.
- `gyrum-session-log` is also cron-able: a periodic run keeps the rolled-up file current from merged-today + warp closures even with no active session.
- Link sessions sequentially; the generator emits the `Previous:` link automatically.
- Don't admin-merge the session-log PR — it's doc-only.
- When the user asks "what's the status" → read today's generated `docs/sessions/<date>.md` + its `docs/sessions/<date>/` fragment dir, then yesterday's.

<!-- doc-truth: ignore-next -->
Pre-warp#2083 logs are at `docs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (singular, hand-written); the generated dated file (warp#6817) reuses that path but is machine-rendered from fragments. Readers check the dated file plus the `docs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD/` fragment dir: `ls dark-factory/docs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md dark-factory/docs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD/ 2>/dev/null`.

## Enforcement gates — depends_on, smoke, pipeline-items, gyrum-warp deps, canon-tier, manifest-flip

Six structural gates (epic warp#273; canon-tier warp#2399, manifest-flip warp#2452) make one failure mode each structurally impossible: UI nobody clicked, pipelines nobody ran, deps nobody checked, `.svelte` duplicating canon, manifest entries pointing at deleted files, props rendered twice. They are LOAD-BEARING.

**Full mechanics — 412-inspect curl, smoke scaffold, the verbatim canon-tier rule + 3 refusal classes, manifest-flip kebab walk, the canon-extension gate family (warp#3707 / #3722 / #3831), and the Why behind every rule — live in [`docs/gyrum/enforcement.md`](docs/gyrum/enforcement.md).** Open it before: inspecting a 412, scaffolding a smoke spec, hitting a canon-tier / manifest-flip / single-prop-render refusal, proposing an architecture fix from code-reading, or deploying a just-merged change.

### `gyrum-warp deps` — preflight before claim

`gyrum-warp deps <id-or-#NNN>` prints the `depends_on` tree with traffic-light status (●/○/✕) so you predict whether `/claim` will 412 BEFORE calling it. Red nodes end with `(blocks claim)`. `--json` machine-readable; `--depth N` caps recursion (default 5). Exit `0` regardless — the tree IS the answer.

### Workflow rules — STRICT (for AI agents, Claude Code, and humans)

- **ALWAYS** run `gyrum-warp deps <id>` before `gyrum-warp claim <id>` if the item has any `depends_on` or is part of an epic — a 412 after a long context-load wastes the session.
- **ALWAYS** include a Playwright smoke at `e2e/<feature>.spec.ts` when touching `src/routes/**` or `src/lib/components/**`. The four assertions (nav-from-root / primary-action / outcome / failure-path) are not optional.
- **ALWAYS** post real playbook evidence to `/api/v1/items/{id}/health` for `kind: pipeline` items — faking green is the same as faking a passing test.
<!-- doc-truth: ignore-next -->
- **ALWAYS** fetch `canon.gyrum.ai/registry.json` and name-match BEFORE authoring a new `.svelte` under `src/lib/components/`.
- **ALWAYS** flip `canon-manifest.yaml lift_state: retired` in the same PR that deletes the source. One-line yaml edit, far cheaper than the audited bypass.
- **ALWAYS** live-probe an API/service/supervisor BEFORE proposing a fix that depends on its behaviour. Paste the actual response into the analysis. If you can't probe, flag the claim as "untested assumption — needs verification" rather than inferring from code reading alone.
- **ALWAYS** confirm your merge SHA is an ancestor of the deploy tag (`git merge-base --is-ancestor <merge-sha> <tag>`) BEFORE deploying "the change you just merged", then live-probe the deployed behaviour. The release pipeline tags incrementally, so the newest tag can pre-date your merge — deploying it ships the wrong binary (warp#4307).
- **NEVER** use `--skip-smoke` without a real audit-logged reason. "I'll add the smoke later" never comes.
- **NEVER** use `--skip-canon-tier` to silence a genuine duplicate or cross-tier violation — the fix is structural.
- **NEVER** use `--skip-manifest-flip` to silence a legitimate retirement — flipping is one yaml line.
- **NEVER** use `--skip-single-prop-render` to silence a genuine duplicate-render — reserve it for a11y / responsive semantic mirrors (warp#3831).
- **NEVER** mark a pipeline-item healthy via the API without an actual playbook run — green-without-exercise lies to every downstream `depends_on`.
- **NEVER** edit `depends_on` to clear a 412 you don't understand. Find out WHY the upstream is failing, fix or `gyrum-warp block` it.
- **NEVER** use `--skip-obs-logs` to silence a genuine logging gap. A deployable backend (a gyrum-catalog manifest declaring a `role:web|internal` service) must log via the canonical gyrum-go `pkg/observ` structured logger and mount `observ.Access()` so handler logs are request-scoped and carry `trace_id` — never bare `fmt.Println`/`log.Printf`/`println` for app logging — and must never silently swallow an error (every `if err != nil {}` block returns or logs). The obs-logs gate completes the three-pillar advisory obs gate family (metrics + traces + logs, parent warp#3340 / ADR-218): all three are Phase-A warn-only (`⚠`, never block), so the skip removes only the warn-row — the gap still ships, just silently. Fix the logging, don't skip the row.
- **NEVER** parent a child that has an open PR / is in_progress under a `kind:epic` that is still `rubric-review:pending` — it SILENTLY gates the child's merge: the warp API 409s `rubric_review_required` on the child's claim, so `gyrum-complete-pr` aborts and an already-green, approved PR sits unmergeable. `gyrum-complete-pr` re-checks and warns LOUDLY, naming the gating EPIC; the ONLY unblock is the operator-only `gyrum-warp approve-rubric <epic>` (agent tokens 403). Parent for tracking only once the rubric is approved — or know the merge stays gated until an operator approves it (warp#9344).

## Engineering standard

Every agent and human working in this repo is held to the staff-engineer
standard below — Judgment first, then craft (TDD, hexagonal architecture, clean
code). This block is the single canonical copy, synced fleet-wide into every
gyrum repo; do not restate it elsewhere. Edit
templates/engineering-standard-body.md in gyrum-labs/devtools and re-sync.

<!-- Canonical engineering standard: single source of truth (warp#9968). Do not

     bumping the section marker version in
     templates/CLAUDE-engineering-standard-section.md so consumer repos pick it up
     on the next sync. -->

## Judgment — the brief is a starting point, not gospel

This is what separates a staff engineer from a faithful implementer, and it
comes *before* the craft rules.

- **Verify, don't trust.** Read the source and live-probe your assumptions before
  you implement. The brief, the ticket, and the bug report can all be wrong —
  confirm the failure and the mechanism yourself. Paste the real
  API/service/command output into your reasoning rather than inferring behaviour
  from a code read alone.
- **Correct wrong instructions.** If the brief or ticket is mistaken, fix it and
  say why — do NOT faithfully implement a mistake. A correct change that
  contradicts the brief beats a faithful one that ships a bug. Name the deviation
  and the evidence for it.
- **Question the premise.** Is this the right fix? the right approach? the right
  ticket at all? Say so *before* writing code down the wrong path. If the work is
  already shipped, already wrong, or collides with something in flight, stop and
  surface it instead of producing a redundant or conflicting change.
- **Own the outcome.** Surface risks, every deviation from the brief with its
  reasoning, and follow-ups. Report what you *verified*, not just what you
  changed; if you could not verify something, flag it as an untested assumption.
- **Fix structurally, not by hand.** For infrastructure and deployment problems,
  drive the fix through the fleet's structural machinery — manifests, warp
  tickets, the deploy pipeline, and the ansible roles — not manual hand-edits on
  hosts. A hand-fix bypasses every gate and drifts from the declared source of
  truth; manual server-side steps are for read-only diagnosis only. When a tool's
  assumption drifts from reality, fix the tool (reconcile + harden), don't work
  around it by hand. The same applies to seeded memory: it is generated by
  seed-claude-memory.sh, so edit the seed and re-run — never hand-edit the
  generated file.
- **Keep a live todo for multi-step work.** For any effort of three or more
  steps, maintain a task list from the start and keep it current — mark a step in
  progress before you begin it, completed only once it is verified done, and
  surface the true state (what has landed vs what is still pending) rather than
  letting a backlog grow silently.

## Rules

1. **Simplicity first.** Prefer removing or simplifying code over adding new
   code. Before creating something new, check if something existing can be
   extended. The best code is code you didn't write.
2. Never write production code without a failing test first. Red → Green →
   Refactor.
3. Domain layer has zero infrastructure imports. All external systems connect
   through ports (interfaces) and adapters.
4. Every exported symbol has a doc comment.
5. Every new package/module gets a README (see Documentation below).
6. Functions do one thing, ~20 lines max, <3 params. Extract a helper past ~40.
7. Wrap errors with context at every boundary: `fmt.Errorf("creating user:
   %w", err)`. Never swallow errors.
8. Name design patterns in comments when used. Only apply them when they reduce
   complexity.
9. Comments explain *why*, never *what*.
10. No magic numbers, no commented-out code, no `// TODO` without a ticket
    reference.
11. Never optimise without profiling first.

## Architecture (Hexagonal)

- **Domain (inner):** Pure business logic, entities, ports (interfaces). No
  framework imports. Rich models.
- **Application (middle):** Use case orchestration via domain services and
  ports. One use case per action.
- **Adapters (outer):** Implements ports. All framework code lives here. Maps
  external formats ↔ domain types.

When you must add a genuinely new responsibility to a file that is already
large, land it in its own module from the first line — decompose at the seam,
not later under gate pressure.

## TDD

**New code:** Smallest failing test → minimum code to pass → refactor → repeat.

**Existing untested code:** Read and map it first. Write `characterises_`-prefixed
tests that pin current behaviour and pass against the untouched code. Only then
refactor with Red → Green → Refactor, using those tests as the safety net.

**Untestable code:** Extract an interface at the dependency boundary (seam)
without changing logic. Comment the seam.

**Blast radius:** Verify the blast radius, not the authorship — run every spec
your change can break, not only the specs you wrote. A change to a shared
module is verified against every route/consumer that imports it; when the
import graph can't be resolved, run MORE, never fewer.

**Naming:** `should_[behaviour]_when_[condition]`. Structure: Arrange / Act /
Assert.

## Documentation

Every new package/module README must include: title + one-line description;
import path; a copy-pasteable quick-start; an API overview (exported symbols,
one line each); 2-3 realistic usage examples; and config/error-handling/test
instructions as applicable. For complex modules add architecture overview, key
decisions, data flow, extension points, and gotchas. Write for a competent
developer who has never seen this codebase.

## Code review lens

When reviewing (your own diff included), check in order: domain purity → test
coverage → single responsibility → naming → error handling → pattern
opportunities. Give direct feedback: explain why something is a problem and give
the preferred approach.

## Patterns (apply only when they reduce complexity)

## Agent capability boundaries — STRICT (for AI agents and Claude Code)

Cross-project rules every Claude Code session in every gyrum repo must follow. Each rule has the shape: Rule, **Why**, **How to apply** — same shape as `feedback_*.md` memory files.

### 1. Build the missing capability, don't ask

**Rule:** In dev/prelaunch, a 403 / missing CLI / missing endpoint / missing field is a signal to file-and-ship the fix yourself, not delegate back to the operator.

**Why:** Operator capacity is the bottleneck; round-tripping every "I can't because X is missing" multiplies wall-clock cost by operator response latency.

**How to apply:** When blocked, check whether shipping the capability is in scope; if yes, file a warp ticket, claim, ship through the standard gates, then resume. Only delegate when genuinely out of reach (prod credentials, identity changes, money ops).

### 2. Agents never touch the operator's CANONICAL checkout

**Rule:** Sub-agents and Claude Code sessions MUST do git work in a SIBLING CLONE under `~/work/gyrum-labs/<repo>-<branch-slug>/`, never in the operator's CANONICAL `~/work/gyrum-labs/<repo>/`.

**Why:** A sub-agent running `git stash` / `checkout` / `pull` in the canonical corrupts the operator's next interactive session. The hyphen-suffix distinction is what makes LSP-in-workspace possible while keeping the canonical protected.

**How to apply:** `gyrum-start-work` cuts the sibling clone by default — use it. If you find yourself in `~/work/gyrum-labs/<repo>/` (no hyphen suffix), stop, push WIP, redo from a fresh `gyrum-start-work` sibling. `gyrum-complete-pr` only cleans up paths whose basename has a hyphen suffix.

### 3. All bugs through warp + start-work flow

**Rule:** Live-discovered "obvious" bugs go through the canonical loop — `gyrum-warp add` → `gyrum-warp claim` → `gyrum-start-work` → review → `gyrum-complete-pr` → `gyrum-warp complete`. Manual `gh pr create` is BLOCKED, not merely discouraged: the repo hook refuses it outright (warp#11010). `gyrum-review-pr` creates the PR itself — with an ADR-134-conformant title, which a hand-created PR lacks and then fails the title-format gate on (warp#12220).

**Why:** Shortcuts skip the review gates, the warp ticket audit trail, and the heartbeat that lets parallel agents see the work-in-flight. "Just a one-line fix" is how regressions ship.

**How to apply:** When you spot a bug mid-session, stop, file a warp ticket with Why/Scope/Acceptance/Process detail, claim, branch via `gyrum-start-work`, fix, review, complete. Then return to the original work.

### 4. Verify ADR before writing brief

**Rule:** Before drafting a sub-agent brief or any prose citing an ADR / runbook / playbook / warp ticket, fetch the actual artefact and quote non-negotiable rules verbatim.

**Why:** Chat memory drifts. Briefs from memory cite ADRs that don't say what's claimed, name missing files, point at wrong-shape warp tickets — the downstream agent then misses the actual constraint.

**How to apply:** For every cited ADR / warp# / runbook, `cat` the path or `curl` the warp API first. Quote the binding sentence into the brief. If it doesn't exist or doesn't say what you remembered, fix the brief.

### 5. Docs must be real info, never fabricated

**Rule:** Every ADR ref, warp ticket number, file path, symbol name, HTTP endpoint cited in a doc / PR body / commit message / brief must be verified to exist before writing. Drop the reference rather than guess.

<!-- doc-truth: ignore-next -->
**Why:** Fabricated references poison the RAG layer, mislead the next agent, and fake grounded work. A doc confidently citing `ADR-203` when it doesn't exist is worse than "I'm not sure".

**How to apply:** Before writing a citation, verify (filesystem / GitHub / warp API / knowledge-base search). If it's not verifiable in <30s, find a different source or omit the claim.

### 6. Admin-override only when size is sole blocker

**Rule:** `gyrum-complete-pr --admin "<reason>"` is permitted ONLY when the merge-blocker is purely structural (e.g. PR exceeds 800-line cap and the unit genuinely can't split). Never bypass a real failure (failing test, real review finding, lint regression).

**Why:** Admin-override is an emergency tool. Routine use ships the bug AND poisons `~/.gyrum/admin-overrides.log` with bypasses that hide the real failure rate.

<!-- doc-truth: ignore-next -->
**How to apply:** Before running `--admin`, write down WHY the unit can't split. If you can't write a structural reason, fix the failure. The reason lands in the audit log; assume the operator reads it. Persona-truncation FP recovery: see [`docs/runbooks/persona-truncation-fp-admin-recovery.md`](https://github.com/gyrum-labs/devtools/blob/main/docs/runbooks/persona-truncation-fp-admin-recovery.md) (warp#3749) — manual recovery path until [warp#3742](https://warp.gyrum.ai/items?q=3742) auto-tool ships.

### 7. Use gyrum-complete-pr for merges

**Rule:** Never `gh pr merge` directly when the devtools are installed. Always `gyrum-review-pr` then `gyrum-complete-pr` from the feature branch.

**Why:** `gh pr merge` skips review-pass verification, structural checks, the `--merge`-not-`--squash` convention, and post-merge version tagging.

**How to apply:** From the feature branch in your `gyrum-start-work` worktree, run `gyrum-review-pr` then `gyrum-complete-pr`. Tempted to reach for `gh pr merge` = signal that something failed; investigate the gate, don't bypass.

### 8. Sub-agent briefs must include gyrum-warp claim

**Rule:** Every sub-agent task mapping to a warp ticket must include `gyrum-warp claim warp#<NNN>` (or `gyrum-warp preflight <uuid>`) in the brief BEFORE `gyrum-start-work`. The sub-agent must claim before opening any branch or PR.

**Why:** Without the claim step, sub-agents start work without claiming, the ticket sits `ready` while five agents race on it, and the operator sees an empty board next to duplicate PRs.

**How to apply:** Brief's first command is `gyrum-warp claim warp#NNN`; last command is `gyrum-warp complete warp#NNN --pr <url>`. Anything else is malformed.

### 9. No hard wraps in GitHub text

**Rule:** PR bodies, commit messages, PR comments, agent briefs, and any other text rendered by GitHub use one paragraph per line. Do not insert manual newlines.

**Why:** Hard-wrapped text renders as broken short lines on GitHub (renderer only collapses single newlines into spaces at <80 cols). Single-line paragraphs render correctly at every viewport.

**How to apply:** One logical line per paragraph; blank lines between paragraphs; lists/code/tables follow normal markdown. Your editor's soft-wrap displays it readably.

### 10. Sub-agents stall at 600s watchdog

**Rule:** Each sub-agent task produces ONE PR, time-boxed 20-25 minutes, atomic-chunk commits. Concurrency cap is 4 simultaneous sub-agents.

**Why:** The harness watchdog kills runs at ~600s without progress; a brief that asks for "5 PRs in sequence" stalls at PR 2 and burns the whole session. Atomic commits also let the operator review progress mid-flight.

**How to apply:** Decompose multi-PR work into N briefs, one PR each. Cap parallel sub-agents at 4. Commit at every meaningful checkpoint so a 600s kill loses minutes, not the whole task.

### 11. Verify agent completion claims against git state

**Rule:** When a sub-agent reports "PR #NNN merged" or "ticket complete", verify against the actual state (`gh pr view`, `git log`, `gyrum-warp ready`) before trusting the claim. Don't propagate prose to the operator.

**Why:** Agents sometimes report success when the work is on a branch with no PR, on a still-draft PR, or on a still-claimed ticket. Forwarding prose without verification makes the operator's status report a lie.

**How to apply:** For every "I shipped X" claim, run the structural check (`gh pr view <N> --json state,mergedAt`, `gyrum-warp ready --all | grep <id>`) before forwarding. If structural disagrees with prose, structural wins.

### 12. Fail-closed config — no silent defaults on secrets

**Rule:** Never `| default('')` / `${VAR:-}` a secret or required config var — a missing value must fail the render/boot loudly. A service whose own state proves a feature was active must treat an empty enabling secret as a boot contradiction, not a toggle (warp#9557).

**Why:** 2026-07-01/02 (warp#9557): a warp container rebuild whose ansible context lacked the vault var rendered `WARP_GITHUB_INGESTION_SECRET=` EMPTY with no error; template, config, and boot each sanctioned "empty", so the fleet went deaf twice in one day and only a detection alarm — no gate — caught it. A silent default converts "misconfigured" into "feature off", which is invisible to every health check that only asks "did it start?".

**How to apply:** Remove the default so a missing value aborts: ansible's StrictUndefined on a bare `{{ var }}`, compose `${VAR:?self-describing message}`, or an explicit non-empty preflight assert that names the vault file. Reserve defaults for vars where empty is EXPLICITLY safe (empty is itself fail-closed, or degrades along a documented operator-visible path) and comment why at the site — dark-factory ships a template-secret-no-silent-default shape gate enforcing the class for ansible templates via a reasoned allowlist. At boot, if service history (non-empty feature-fed tables) contradicts an empty enabling secret, refuse to start or scream on a critical log/metric — never quietly disable.

## Orientation — read ORIENTATION.md before touching code

<!-- doc-truth: ignore-next — ORIENTATION.md is generated at every onboarded repo's root by gyrum-orient; absent in a not-yet-onboarded stub -->
This repo carries a generated **`ORIENTATION.md`** at its root: a
one-screen brief of the repo's purpose, stack, run/test commands,
entry points, and the conventions + review gates that govern it.
**Read it before touching code** — it is the fastest way to learn
what this repo is for and how its review cycle is shaped, and it is
kept honest by a gate so it cannot silently rot.

### NEVER hand-edit ORIENTATION.md

<!-- doc-truth: ignore-next — ORIENTATION.md is generated at the repo root; absent in a not-yet-onboarded stub -->
`ORIENTATION.md` is **generated, never hand-authored.** The source
<!-- doc-truth: ignore-next — repo-meta.yaml is the hand-authored source at the repo root; absent in a not-yet-onboarded stub -->
of truth is the hand-maintained **`repo-meta.yaml`** at the repo root
(six required fields: `name`, `purpose`, `layer`, `status`, `owner`,
`links`; optional `test_cmd`). To change what the orientation says,
<!-- doc-truth: ignore-next — repo-meta.yaml is the hand-authored source at the repo root; absent in a not-yet-onboarded stub -->
edit `repo-meta.yaml` and regenerate:

```text
gyrum-orient            # regenerate ORIENTATION.md at the repo root
gyrum-orient --check    # diff a fresh render vs the committed file
gyrum-orient --init     # scaffold repo-meta.yaml in a not-yet-onboarded repo
```

The generator is deterministic — same inputs produce a byte-identical
file (no timestamps), so a re-run only changes the file when the
inputs actually changed. A hand-edit gets stomped on the next regen.

### The orientation-drift gate keeps the two in sync

`gyrum-review-pr` runs an **orientation-drift gate**. If the committed
<!-- doc-truth: ignore-next — ORIENTATION.md / repo-meta.yaml live at every onboarded repo's root; absent in a not-yet-onboarded stub -->
`ORIENTATION.md` no longer matches a fresh render of `repo-meta.yaml`
plus the repo scan, the gate flags it. The gate is in **warn-mode**
now (an advisory `⚠` row; it flips to a hard `✗` once fleet coverage
is full, via `GYRUM_ORIENTATION_GATE_HARD=1` — no date cutover). A
<!-- doc-truth: ignore-next — repo-meta.yaml lives at every onboarded repo's root; absent in a not-yet-onboarded stub -->
repo with no `repo-meta.yaml` at all gets a single `⚠ not onboarded`
nudge and is never blocked. The fix is always the same: run
`gyrum-orient` and commit the regenerated file.

### Reading other repos / the fleet — gyrum-warp orient

You do **not** need a checkout to read a repo's orientation:

```text
gyrum-warp orient                      # inside a repo: serve its local ORIENTATION.md
gyrum-warp orient --repo <name>        # any fleet repo's orientation (bare names default to gyrum-labs/)
gyrum-warp orient --ticket warp#N      # resolve the item's repo, then serve it
gyrum-warp orient --fleet              # the fleet digest (dark-factory docs/REPOS.md)
```

<!-- doc-truth: ignore-next — ORIENTATION.md lives at every onboarded repo's root; absent in a not-yet-onboarded stub -->
Local wins: inside a git repo whose root has an `ORIENTATION.md`, the
local file is served (works offline) and takes precedence over the
lagging fleet aggregate. The supported `warp-orient` command is the shorter
equivalent of the newer `gyrum-warp orient` syntax; both return the same
orientation result.

### This repo's gate profile

Which review gates fire here is declared by the root repo-type file's
<!-- doc-truth: ignore-next — repo-type.yaml lives at the repo root; the gates: block is optional and absent on repos that default into the fleet profile -->
`gates:` block in `repo-type.yaml` (profile + per-gate `require` /
`exclude` / `overrides`). A repo with no `gates:` block defaults into
the **gyrum-fleet** profile — every gate enabled, behaviour identical
to before profiles existed. Non-fleet products typically declare
`profile: standard` (the portable structural + orientation + doc-pair
+ changelog + pr-shape set) and gyrum's own UI repos default into the
fleet profile. For any gate this repo's profile excludes,
`gyrum-review-pr` prints a `∅ disabled by repo gate profile` row — a
`∅` row is not a failure, it is the profile working as declared. Read
the gate block to learn which gates govern your PR before opening it.

### Lifecycle journeys

This repo may owe lifecycle docs (a brief, a design system) that the
project-journey substrate tracks. To learn which docs are still owed:

```text
gyrum-project-journey check <journey>   # what this repo still owes (e.g. create-project)
gyrum-project-journey list              # the available journeys
```

To scaffold the docs + gates a lifecycle stage needs, run the matching
journey — `create-project` (repo + brief + design-system + gates +
orientation + EPIC kick-off), `new-feature`, `new-design-system`, or
`new-epic`:

```text
gyrum-project-journey run <journey> --project <name>
```

The freshly instantiated docs carry TODO placeholders only; their
section bodies are HTML comments, so the `doc-sections` gate
deliberately fails until a contributor fills them with real prose —
that is the mechanism by which project docs become mandatory before
agents work.

### Claim output carries an `── ORIENTATION ──` block — follow its posture

Every successful `gyrum-warp claim` appends the
claimed repo's orientation as a `── ORIENTATION ──` block, with an
audience posture you must follow:

- **engineer** (interactive): on ambiguity, a contradiction with the
  code, or an unpinned decision — **ask the operator** (or file a
  docs-drift ticket). Silent inference is a bug.
- **pipeline** (non-interactive): **fail closed.** If orientation is
  missing, stale, or contradicts the code, stop and emit a structural
  finding — do not improvise context.

Claim is best-effort about serving orientation (a claim never fails
because orientation could not be served) and logs the
oriented-version to `~/.gyrum/orient-claims.jsonl` so reviews can
compare oriented-version vs current.

This block is regenerated by `gyrum-setup` whenever the template
version bumps. To refresh without a full setup run:
`gyrum-setup --sync-claudemd`.
<!-- gyrum-orient-section-v5:END -->

<!-- gyrum-canon-registry-section-v2:START -->
## Canon registry — fetch design primitives before building UI

The fleet's design system canon lives at **[canon.gyrum.ai](https://canon.gyrum.ai/)**.
It is federated: each contributing repo owns its slice (tokens in
`gyrum-ui`, ADRs + principles in `dark-factory`, components in
`gyrum-ui`'s `packages/components/`); canon stitches them together
into one searchable surface.

For AI agents, **the load-bearing artefact is
[canon.gyrum.ai/registry.json](https://canon.gyrum.ai/registry.json)**
— a machine-readable index of every section canon renders. Fetch it
at session start when the task involves authoring or modifying UI;
cite the section `id` (and, once Phase 4 / warp#2289 lands, the
per-primitive `catalog_id`) in your PR body so persona reviewers
can verify you used the canon as oracle, not invented a parallel
shape.

### When to consult the canon

- **Adding a UI surface in any fleet repo** (warp/web, ai-frontend,
  canon itself). Read the relevant section first; don't reinvent a
  primitive that already exists.
- **Changing a token or component shape**. The canonical source is in
  `gyrum-ui` (per the federation rule); a PR in a consumer repo
  cannot redefine it. If a change is needed, the change PR lands in
  `gyrum-ui` and consumers reskin on the next published version.
- **Writing an ADR or principle**. The canon's `/decisions` and
  `/principles` sections render from `dark-factory/docs/decisions/`
  and `dark-factory/docs/principles/` — write there, the canon
  picks it up on the next deploy.

### Workflow

```text
1. curl -s https://canon.gyrum.ai/registry.json | jq '.sections[].id'
   → tokens components decisions principles search
2. Pick the section your task touches; fetch its `source` field to
   reach the canonical-source repo + path.
3. Reuse what's there. If you need a new primitive, propose it via
   the contributing repo's PR flow — canon will pick it up on the
   next regen.
4. In your PR body, cite the section id (and `catalog_id` once
   Phase 4 ships): `Canon: components#gy-card` / `Canon: tokens#colour.status`.
```

### Authoring new canon — in-ticket vs sister ticket

When your work needs a canon primitive that doesn't yet exist, the
<!-- doc-truth: ignore-next — lib/canon-tier-gate.sh lives in devtools, not a fresh consumer repo -->
canon-tier-gate (`lib/canon-tier-gate.sh`) defaults to *"register it
in the same PR"*. That's **Path A (in-ticket)**. The exception,
**Path B (sister ticket)**, applies when the new primitive sits at a
tier *deeper* than your consumer's tier — atoms in particular deserve
their own review cycle because they have many future consumers.

**Decision rule — match authoring tier against consuming tier:**

- Authoring **at or above** your consumer's tier → **Path A
  <!-- doc-truth: ignore-next — canon-manifest.yaml lives in gyrum-ui, not this repo -->
  (in-ticket).** Register in `canon-manifest.yaml` in the same diff
  and ship in one PR. Example: a `+page.svelte` (tier 5) needs a new
  <!-- doc-truth: ignore-next — NameTemplate.svelte is an illustrative canon name, not a repo file -->
  `NameTemplate.svelte` (tier 4) — author the template + the page
  refactor together. The reviewer sees the contract end-to-end and
  the canon ships battle-tested by its first real consumer.
- Authoring **below** your consumer's tier → **Path B (sister
  ticket).** File a sister warp item for the canon authoring; tag
  your current ticket `blocked-by:warp#<sister>`; the sister ships
  its own PR with its own review cycle. Example: a template-tier
  consumer needs a genuinely novel atom-tier primitive with no
  current consumer expressing that shape — atoms have many future
  consumers, the visual contract deserves dedicated review.

**Why same-PR is the default:**

- **No orphan canon.** Authoring without a real consumer produces
  speculative components that drift from actual usage shape.
- **Reviewer sees the contract end-to-end.** Persona reviewers
  (Marcus in particular) judge *"is this a sound abstraction?"*
  AND *"does the consumer use it correctly?"* in one read.
- **Atomic shipping.** Canon + first consumer either both land or
  both don't — no half-merged state where the canon exists but
  nothing consumes it (or vice versa).
- **Battle-tested by second-consumer time.** The canon has survived
  one real review + smoke spec before the next consumer needs it.

**How to apply:** before opening `gyrum-start-work`, identify every
canon primitive your consumer needs. If it exists in
<!-- doc-truth: ignore-next — canon-manifest.yaml lives in gyrum-ui, not this repo -->
`canon-manifest.yaml` → consume the existing adapter, do not fork.
If not → check tier: author-tier ≥ consumer-tier picks Path A
<!-- doc-truth: ignore-next — canon-manifest.yaml lives in gyrum-ui, not this repo -->
(in-ticket; register in `canon-manifest.yaml` in the same diff);
author-tier < consumer-tier picks Path B (sister ticket; tag
`blocked-by:warp#<sister>`; wait). The
<!-- doc-truth: ignore-next — lib/canon-tier-gate.sh lives in devtools, not a fresh consumer repo -->
`canon_tier_lift_entry_gate` (`lib/canon-tier-gate.sh`, Pattern 4)
enforces the manifest-entry + tracking-ticket shape mechanically;
this subsection ensures agents pick the right path *before* hitting
the gate.

### Workflow rules — STRICT (for AI agents)

<!-- doc-truth: ignore-next — canon.gyrum.ai/registry.json is a live URL, not a repo-local path -->
- **ALWAYS** consult `canon.gyrum.ai/registry.json` before authoring
  or modifying UI primitives. A PR that invents a parallel shape of
  an existing primitive is a refactor-to-canon PR waiting to happen
  — save the swarm the cycle.
- **ALWAYS** cite the section id (and `catalog_id` once Phase 4
  ships) in the PR body. Persona reviewers (gyrum-marcus,
  gyrum-priya) verify against this; an uncited UI PR is a review
  flag.
- **NEVER** copy a primitive's source into a different repo. Canon is
  federation, not extraction — every primitive has a single canonical
  home (tokens in `gyrum-ui`, ADRs in `dark-factory`, components in
  `gyrum-ui`). Consumers pull-by-version, never fork.
<!-- doc-truth: ignore-next — registry.json is canon's generated artefact, not a repo-local file -->
- **NEVER** edit `registry.json` by hand. It is regenerated on every
  `canon` deploy from the contributing repos' canon-manifest.yaml.
  Drift surfaces structurally — a hand-edit gets stomped on the
  next build.
- **ALWAYS** pick Path A (in-ticket) when authoring canon at or above
  your consumer's tier; pick Path B (sister ticket +
  `blocked-by:warp#<sister>`) only when the new primitive sits at a
  tier *deeper* than the consumer. Same-PR is the default because it
  prevents orphan canon and lets one reviewer judge the contract
  end-to-end; cross-tier-deeper authoring earns its own review cycle
  because the primitive will have many future consumers.

Cross-link: the federation rationale + the 5-section breakdown +
the upcoming per-primitive `catalog_id` schema live in the
[Canon Site EPIC (warp#2284)](https://warp.gyrum.ai/items/2284) and
its [canon README](https://github.com/gyrum-labs/canon/blob/main/README.md).
<!-- doc-truth: ignore-next — lib/canon-tier-gate.sh lives in devtools, not a fresh consumer repo -->
The in-ticket-vs-sister rule body lives in `lib/canon-tier-gate.sh`
source comments and was lifted into this template at
[warp#3100](https://warp.gyrum.ai/items/3100) so agents read it
*before* `gyrum-start-work` rather than after the gate refuses.

### Always

On any denied gate: **STOP**, surface to operator, do not escalate via
`--admin` / `--force` / repeated retries. The verb refused for a reason;
escalating is the failure mode this manifest exists to prevent.

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED on gyrum-setup --sync-claudemd (warp#7930 / EPIC warp#7916, B3).
     Source of truth: this repo's seam manifest (the A2 / warp#7924 manifest).
     The body below is rendered by sync_claudemd_seam_contracts_section
     (claudemd-sync lib): it partitions the declared seams into the ones this
     repo PROVIDES (it is the provider) and the ones it CONSUMES (it is the
     consumer). Hand-edits to this block are overwritten on the next sync.
     To change what this section says, edit the seam manifest and re-run
     gyrum-setup --sync-claudemd. The v1 marker bumps only on a STRUCTURAL
     change (new column/field); seam add/remove refreshes silently. -->
## Seam contracts

This repo's cross-project seams — the field-shape contracts it sits on
(Bidirectional Contract Testing, EPIC warp#7916). A **seam** is one
consumer→provider JSON-shape dependency across two repos. Read this at session
start so you know which contracts you own before you touch them; the data is
<!-- doc-truth: ignore-next — seams.yaml is the per-repo A2 manifest at the repo root; absent in a repo that declares no seams -->
rendered from this repo's `seams.yaml`, never hand-authored here.

- **Provides** — seams where this repo is the *provider*. Breaking the listed
  response shape needs the consumer to migrate first (expand-contract); the
  conformance test (the warp#7920 kin-openapi live-response check) keeps the
  published spec honest.
- **Consumes** — seams where this repo is the *consumer*. The entrypoint is the
  <!-- doc-truth: ignore-next — consumer_reads / seams.yaml are declared per-seam; they resolve only in a repo that consumes a seam -->
  file performing the reads; `consumer_reads` in `seams.yaml` is the declared
  field subset checked against the provider spec by `gyrum-seam-check`.

_No declared seams for this repo._ This repo declares no cross-project seams (it has no seam manifest, or none of its seams touch this repo). When it starts providing or consuming a cross-repo JSON shape, declare the seam and re-run gyrum-setup --sync-claudemd to surface it here.

To verify a seam locally, run `gyrum-seam-check` (the A2 / warp#7924
consumer-subset checker). To add or change a seam, edit the seam manifest and
run gyrum-setup --sync-claudemd to refresh this block.
